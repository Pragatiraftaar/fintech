Stock Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and building a machine learning model to predict stock prices/trends. The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, feature preparation, model training, and evaluation to understand stock movement patterns.

Project Objectives
Load and analyze historical stock market dataset
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Visualize stock price trends using graphs
Prepare features for training and testing
Train ML model for stock price prediction
Evaluate model performance and predictions

Tech Stack
Python
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Scikit-learn

Workflow (Notebook Steps)
Import required libraries
Load stock dataset
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualizations
Feature selection and train-test split
Model training for prediction
Model evaluation and prediction comparison
Final output visualization

How to Run
Open the notebook:
stock1 (1).ipynb

Install required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Run the notebook cells in sequence.

Output
Stock trend graphs and analysis
Trained model for prediction
Predicted vs actual stock values visualization
Performance evaluation metrics
Future Improvements
Use deep learning models like LSTM for time-series forecasting
Add technical indicators (RSI, MACD, moving averages)
Support multiple stocks and real-time data APIs
Deploy as a web dashboard for prediction
